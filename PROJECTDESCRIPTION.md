#This CS460W-ER-Project is a culmination of three individuals, Aden Dâ€™occhio, Alessandro DiCesare, and Fatima Chowdury.
#During the course of the CS460W Software Development, the team was tasked with creating a program designed to function as a hospital emergency room department, assisting with information intake, patient labs, diagnosis, prescriptions, discharge and billing.
#Professor Ingrid Russell served as the "client" in this example of what a software development company would do in said relationship.
#She specified what was required of the program, what types of situations and treatments it should handle, and what types of employees would have different permissions in the system.
#There was also the main requirement of storing the information so that there is record-keeping, and so that the information can be called back/manipulated at any point in the future.
#Throughout each Deliverable Folder, you will find the detailed documentation that was due at a dated "checkpoint" in the course.
#Each document/image will shed a better light on the structure and behavior of the program as it was developed. Some documentation is updated further in another deliverable down the road.
#This project has been completed to the specifications provided by Professor Ingrid Russell; no further changes are recommended at this time.
